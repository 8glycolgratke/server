In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use AutoCAD 2009 64 Bit for different design projects. We will also give you some tips and tricks to make your work easier and faster.
 
## Example 1: Creating a floor plan
 
A floor plan is a drawing that shows the layout of a building or a room from a top view. It usually includes walls, doors, windows, furniture, appliances, and other elements. A floor plan can help you plan and visualize the space and function of a room or a building.
 
To create a floor plan in AutoCAD 2009 64 Bit, you can follow these steps:

1. Start a new drawing and set the units and scale. You can use the UNITS command to set the units and the SCALELISTEDIT command to set the scale.
2. Draw the walls using the LINE or POLYLINE command. You can use the ORTHO mode to draw horizontal and vertical lines. You can also use the OFFSET command to create parallel walls.
3. Draw the doors and windows using the DOOR and WINDOW commands. You can specify the size, style, and location of the doors and windows. You can also use the TRIM command to cut the walls where the doors and windows are inserted.
4. Draw the furniture and appliances using the BLOCK command. You can create your own blocks or use the ones from the DesignCenter or Tool Palettes. You can also use the INSERT command to insert blocks into your drawing.
5. Add dimensions and annotations using the DIMENSION and TEXT commands. You can use the DIMSTYLE command to create and modify dimension styles. You can also use the MTEXT command to create multiline text.
6. Add hatches and fills using the HATCH command. You can use the BHATCH command to create boundary hatches. You can also use the GRADIENT command to create gradient fills.
