## How Piratrax Pro 19 Works
 
Piratrax Pro 19 is a two-component product that consists of a resin and a hardener. When mixed together, they form a liquid that can be applied to any roof surface. The liquid then cures and hardens into a solid membrane that bonds to the roof substrate. The membrane creates a waterproof and weatherproof barrier that prevents water and air infiltration.
 
The membrane also has elastic properties that allow it to expand and contract with the roof movements. This prevents cracking and peeling of the membrane and the roof surface. The membrane also has self-healing properties that enable it to seal minor punctures and damages automatically. The membrane can also bridge gaps and joints on the roof surface, creating a seamless and uniform layer.
 
Piratrax Pro 19 is not only a protective product, but also a decorative product. It comes in various colors and finishes that can suit any roof style and design. You can choose from matte, glossy, metallic, or textured finishes. You can also customize the color of the product to match your building's exterior. Piratrax Pro 19 can enhance the appearance and value of your property.
