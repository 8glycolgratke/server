# How to Play Fifa Street 4 on PC with Emulators
 
Fifa Street 4 is a football/soccer game that was released in 2012 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It features street-style matches with various rules and locations, as well as a World Tour mode where you can create your own team and compete against other players. If you want to play Fifa Street 4 on your PC, you will need an emulator that can run PS3 or Xbox 360 games.
 
An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another device, allowing you to run games and applications that are not compatible with your current system. There are several emulators available for PC that can run PS3 or Xbox 360 games, such as RPCS3, Xenia, or PCSX2. However, not all games are fully playable or stable on these emulators, so you may encounter some issues or glitches while playing Fifa Street 4.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install RPCS3, a PS3 emulator that can run Fifa Street 4 on PC with high resolution and performance. We will also provide you with some tips and tricks to optimize your settings and improve your gameplay experience.
  
## Step 1: Download and Install RPCS3
 
RPCS3 is an open-source PS3 emulator that can run many PS3 games on PC with high compatibility and performance. It supports various features such as resolution scaling, texture filtering, post-processing shaders, save states, controller mapping, and more. You can download RPCS3 from its official website: [https://rpcs3.net/](https://rpcs3.net/).
 
Once you have downloaded the RPCS3 installer, run it and follow the instructions to install the emulator on your PC. You will also need to install some additional software such as Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages, DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer, and Vulkan Runtime Libraries. These are required for RPCS3 to function properly.
  
## Step 2: Download and Install Fifa Street 4
 
After installing RPCS3, you will need to obtain a copy of Fifa Street 4 for PS3. You can either use a physical disc or a digital download. If you have a physical disc, you will need to dump it using a compatible Blu-ray drive and a program such as ImgBurn. If you have a digital download, you will need to extract it using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
Once you have the game files, you will need to place them in a folder on your PC. You can name the folder anything you want, but we recommend using something descriptive such as "Fifa Street 4". Then, open RPCS3 and click on "File" > "Add Games" and select the folder where you placed the game files. RPCS3 will scan the folder and add Fifa Street 4 to your game list.
