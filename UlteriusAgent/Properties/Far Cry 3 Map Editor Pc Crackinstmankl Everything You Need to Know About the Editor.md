# How to Use Far Cry 3 Map Editor on PC
 
Far Cry 3 is a popular open-world first-person shooter game that was released in 2012. One of the features that makes this game stand out is the map editor, which allows players to create their own custom maps and share them with others. The map editor is accessed from the main menu of the console version of Far Cry 3, but for those with the PC version of FC3, a little bit of navigating has to be done, as you will not find that utility on the main menu[^3^]. In this article, we will show you how to use the Far Cry 3 map editor on PC and some tips and tricks to make your maps more fun and engaging.
  
## How to Find the Map Editor on PC
 
To find the map editor on PC, you need to visit the directory where you placed all of your Far Cry 3 files, such as C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Far Cry 3\\bin or possibly C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Ubisoft\\Far Cry 3\\bin[^3^]. Or if you downloaded Far Cry 3 from Steam with Windows 7 64bit C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Far Cry 3\\bin[^3^]. An easier way to find the location of the directory is simply right clicking whichever Far Cry 3.exe file you've been opening in order to run the game, and clicking on "Open File Location", which should be the third option from the top. This will open up the bin folder shown up above[^3^]. After you've found the bin folder for Far Cry 3 on your computer's hard drive, look for the executable (Application) named FC3Editor. Run that, and you're all set[^3^].
