If you are looking for a filter plugin that can do more than just the usual lowpass, highpass and bandpass, you might want to check out Sugar Bytes WOW V1.1. This plugin features 10 filter types, including a unique vowel mode that can make any sound "talk". It also has a powerful modulation system that lets you mix and modulate different sources, such as an envelope follower, an LFO and a step sequencer. And if that's not enough, it also has an overdrive section that can add some warmth and grit to your filter sounds.
 
Sugar Bytes WOW V1.1 is available as a VST, AU and AAX plugin for Windows and Mac, as well as a standalone application. It comes with a serial number for copy protection, and you can download it from the Sugar Bytes website or from various online shops.

In this review, we will take a closer look at the features and sound of Sugar Bytes WOW V1.1, and see how it compares to other filter plugins on the market.
 
## Filter Types
 
The first thing you will notice when you open Sugar Bytes WOW V1.1 is the large filter knob that lets you choose from 10 different filter types. These are:
 
- 12/24db Highpass: A classic highpass filter that cuts off the low frequencies.
- 12/24db Bandpass: A classic bandpass filter that cuts off the high and low frequencies.
- 12/24db Lowpass: A classic lowpass filter that cuts off the high frequencies.
- Comb Filter: A filter that creates a comb-like frequency response by adding a delayed version of the input signal to itself.
- Band Reject: A filter that cuts off a wide band of frequencies around the cutoff point.
- Band Crusher: A filter that reduces the sample rate of the input signal to match the cutoff frequency, creating a bitcrushed effect.
- LF Crusher: A filter that reduces the sample rate of the low frequencies of the input signal to match the cutoff frequency, creating a low-fi effect.
- Vowel Mode: A filter that morphs between two vowel sounds (U, UE, O, OE, A, A:, AE, E, I) based on the cutoff knob position. You can use any of the other filter types in this mode as well.

The filter knob also has a mix control that lets you blend between the filtered and original signal. This can be useful for creating parallel effects or adding some dry signal back to preserve some dynamics.
 
The filter types sound very good and offer a lot of variety. The vowel mode is especially fun and creative, as it can turn any sound into a vocal-like texture. The band crusher and LF crusher filters are also great for adding some digital distortion and lo-fi character to your sounds.
 
## Modulation System
 
The next thing you will notice when you open Sugar Bytes WOW V1.1 is the modulation system that consists of three modules: an envelope follower, an LFO and a step sequencer. Each module has its own set of parameters and can be assigned to modulate any of the filter parameters (cutoff, resonance, mix) or each other (for example, you can modulate the LFO rate with the envelope follower).
 
The envelope follower module tracks the amplitude of the input signal and converts it into a modulation signal. You can adjust the gain, attack and release of the envelope follower, as well as choose between three frequency bands (low, mid or high) to focus on. The envelope follower can be useful for creating dynamic effects that react to the input level or frequency content.

The LFO module generates a periodic modulation signal with various waveforms (sine, triangle, sawtooth, square or random). You can adjust the rate, phase and symmetry of the LFO, as well as sync it to the host tempo or retrigger it by the input signal. The LFO can be useful for creating
