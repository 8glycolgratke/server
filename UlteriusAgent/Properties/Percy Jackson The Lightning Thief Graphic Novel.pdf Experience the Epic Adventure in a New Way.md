The story revolves around Percy Jackson, a 12-year-old boy who discovers that he is a demigod, the son of a Greek god and a mortal woman. He is accused of stealing Zeus' lightning bolt, the most powerful weapon in the world, and has to go on a quest with his friends Annabeth and Grover to find the real thief and prevent a war among the gods.
 
The graphic novel does a great job of capturing the humor, action, and emotion of the original book. The illustrations are colorful and detailed, and the characters are expressive and faithful to their descriptions. The graphic novel also includes some scenes that were not in the movie adaptation, such as Percy's encounter with the Furies on a bus, or his visit to the Oracle at Camp Half-Blood.
 
However, some fans might be disappointed by the amount of content that was cut or changed from the original book. For example, some of Percy's internal monologue and narration are missing, which makes him less relatable and witty. Some of the minor characters and subplots are also omitted or simplified, such as Clarisse's rivalry with Percy, or Percy's relationship with his mother and stepfather.
 
Overall, the graphic novel is a fun and fast-paced way to revisit or introduce yourself to the world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It is not a substitute for the original book, but rather a complement that enhances the reading experience. If you enjoy mythology, adventure, and humor, you will love this graphic novel.
