- **S1 Imager** is the main plugin that allows you to adjust the width, center, and rotation of the stereo image. You can also use it to invert the phase or swap the channels of the input signal.
- **S1 Shuffler** is a classic phase-compensated âshufflerâ that enhances the stereo spaciousness and improves the image quality at the bass end of the audio spectrum[^2^]. You can control the amount of shuffling and the range of frequencies affected by it.
- **S1 MS Matrix** is a utility plugin that enables mid-side processing. You can use it to encode a stereo signal into mid-side components or decode a mid-side signal into stereo components. You can also adjust the level and width of each component separately.

## How to Use Waves S1 Stereo Imager?
 
Waves S1 Stereo Imager can be used on any stereo track, bus, or master channel in your DAW. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can use one or more of the plugins in the suite to achieve different effects. Here are some examples of how to use Waves S1 Stereo Imager in different scenarios:
 
### Scenario 1: Correcting an Unbalanced Stereo Mix
 
If you have a stereo mix that is unbalanced, meaning that one channel is louder or more dominant than the other, you can use Waves S1 Imager to fix it. Here are the steps:

1. Insert Waves S1 Imager on your stereo mix channel.
2. Use the *Width* control to adjust the overall width of the stereo image. A negative value will narrow the image, while a positive value will widen it.
3. Use the *Center* control to adjust the position of the center image. A negative value will move it to the left, while a positive value will move it to the right.
4. Use the *Rotation* control to rotate the entire stereo image around its center point. A negative value will rotate it counterclockwise, while a positive value will rotate it clockwise.
5. Use the *Invert L/R* button to invert the phase of one channel relative to the other. This can help fix phase issues or create interesting effects.
6. Use the *Swap L/R* button to swap the left and right channels. This can help fix channel assignment errors or create interesting effects.
7. Use the *Bypass* button to compare your processed signal with your original signal.
8. Use the *Mono* button to check your mono compatibility. Your mix should sound balanced and clear in mono as well as in stereo. 8cf37b1e13
